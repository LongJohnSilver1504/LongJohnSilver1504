### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daher, I'm 30 years old. I'm a computer scientist, software craftsman, and, by default, someone passionate about software development. I always try to solve problems with simple solutions and clean code. I am a team player and I am constantly trying to improve my team by learning, teaching, and sharing. I am always curious and love to experiment with new tools, languages, or frameworks. I am in a constant search for better and more efficient ways to deliver value through software, to be a better professional and a better person.
